                            Local storage is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be
                            stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for
                            storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. <br>
                            Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session.
                            This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage
                            is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data
                            gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or
                            manually
                        </li>

                    In javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are
                    contained in this global scope.

                    Another is the Local Scope, variables declared inside the functions are considered to be of the
                    local scope and it is futher divided into function scoped and block scoped.

                    Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that
                    function and cannot be used outside that function.

                    Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while
                    loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared
                    inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.

                    The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the 
                    Callback Queue or Message Queue. 
                    
                    If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
                    Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. 
                    
                    Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. 
                    Each event is just a function callback.
                    
                    Explanation : 
                    When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises, then these task takes some time to complete I/O if they have any. 
                    If they completed their I/O or don't have any, then they simply put into 
                    message queue or callback queue. Then event loop will firstly execute the 
                    call stack tasks and then look for callback or message queue and then execute it.
